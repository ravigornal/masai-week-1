        <!-- Description(History) of Chip and Dale -->
        <div style="color: blanchedalmond">
            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Chip and Dale (also rendered as Chip 'n' Dale or Chip an' Dale) are two anthropomorphic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipmunk">
                    chipmunk</a>brothers created at Walt Disney Productions in 1943. Their names are a pun based on the name of the famous 18th-century 
                    cabinet maker and furniture designer Thomas Chippendale. This was suggested by Bill "Tex" Henson, a story artist at the studio. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of the two, Chip is portrayed as being safe, focused, and having a mind for logical scheming. 
                    Dale, by contrast, is more laid-back, dim-witted, and impulsive, and has a very strong sense of humor. 
                    Originally the two had a very similar appearance, but as a way to tell them apart, some differences were introduced: 
                    Chip has a small black nose (which somewhat resembles a chocolate "chip", as befitting his name) and two centered protruding teeth, 
                    whereas Dale has a large dark red nose and a prominent gap between his buckteeth. 
                    Chip is also depicted as having smooth hair on top of his head while Dale's tends to be ruffled. 
                </p>          
                <p>
                    In most cartoons, they are antagonists against Pluto, Mickey Mouse, or most often, Donald Duck. 
                    They were given their own series in the 1950s, but only three cartoons resulted under their name: 
                    Chicken in the Rough (1951), Two Chips and a Miss (1952) and The Lone Chipmunks (1954). 
                    The duo was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film three times in four years: 
                    in 1946 for Squatter's Rights (against Mickey and Pluto), in 1947 for Chip an' Dale and in 1949 for Toy Tinkers (both against Donald Duck).
